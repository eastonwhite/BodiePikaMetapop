Pika metapopulation project
=====

This repository contains R scripts for analyses to appear in White et al (2015)-in prep. Please contact Easton White (eawhite@ucdavis.edu) for more information. 

The R script SimpleBodieModel_model.R is a stochastic simulation of the Bodie pika metapopulation as a spatially explicit array of patches (n=79) that incorporates field data on patch locations. The model was parameterized with demographic and spatial data from the Bodie metapopulation, which has been studied nearly continuously for 6 decades.
